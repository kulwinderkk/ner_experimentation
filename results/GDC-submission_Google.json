We believe that many of the challenges of our era can only be effectively addressed by global collaboration across borders. Whether it's a pandemic, climate change, or the health of the global economy, we live in an interconnected world in which international organizations like the United Nations, governments, civil society, and private sector businesses like Google must work together to tackle humanity's collective challenges to realize a more prosperous future for all. Among the most important of those challenges is accelerating the world's digital transformation in ways that advance opportunity for all people and protect our planet. Technological innovation holds tremendous promise not just to democratize access to next-generation tools but also to accelerate progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.",

We work to raise up authoritative sources, and reduce the spread of harmful content, in recommendations and elsewhere. Teams across the company work in a variety of roles to help develop and enforce our policies, monitor our platforms for abuse, and protect users from everything from account hijackings and disinformation or harassment campaigns to terrorist content and inauthentic activity. Beyond our own platforms, Google's Jigsaw team is also developing new approaches to proactively protect the integrity of information across the internet through initiatives like disinformation 'prebunking', and building tools that allow other platforms and organizations to identify and remove toxic comments or violent extremist content before it spreads. Jigsaw's tools are free and open-sourced, and its research is regularly published to benefit the broader ecosystem.",

Google Search serves as an index of all pages available on the open web, where users expect to find every legal webpage pertaining to their query. Therefore, it leans toward the least restrictive end of that spectrum. On the other end, our advertising products are among the most restrictive, as we do not want to profit from those who create harmful content or experiences. Other products fall elsewhere on the spectrum. For instance, Gmail involves minimal limitations on content, while YouTube is a platform for uploading and sharing content as part of a community, which requires broader prohibitions than Google Search.",
