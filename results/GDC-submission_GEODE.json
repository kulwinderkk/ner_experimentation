The Council condemns measures that seek to ' intentionally prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information online in violation of international human rights law, and calls upon all States to refrain from and cease such measures ', relying on a substantial number of secondary legislation not specifically related to the issue of Internet access. Several UN Special Rapporteurs have recognized the fundamental nature of the right of access to the Internet through the prism of freedom of expression or the right to peaceful assembly. However, this right of access to the internet should not be construed as a duty of States to provide access without any charge.",

Internet fragmentation notably includes creating bans on global social media platforms or search engines with the intent to prevent citizens from accessing content that is of vital interest to them and may help them keep informed. This type of measure can be a way for governments to control the digital activities carried out 'on' their territory, to isolate their country from the rest of the network and even to create blackout situations for populations in the case of internet shutdowns. Users often use VPNs to bypass these restrictions. However, such practices have been deemed unlawful by several legislations across the globe, in order to discourage them, while most users are unaware of how to safely use VPNs.",

In a context where non-state actors, especially companies, are the main holders of this data, the under-representation of certain regions of the world and the concentration of capacities in the hands of a few actors present a risk for cultural and social diversity and international development. Thus AI contributes to the reinforcement of the digital divide and the confinement of the individual through the prism of data.

States are competing to impose different conceptions of Internet governance: some of them see the digital sphere as an essentially economic opportunity, some focus on human development and others give priority to state security. These conflicting conceptions hinder the application and adaptation of international law to digital activities. The geopolitical challenges surrounding Internet governance also affect the model of cyberspace itself, contributing to its fragmentation, the integration or non-integration of infrastructures, the inclusion or exclusion of the informational dimension. Internet governance depends on the way in which the Internet and, more generally, the digital object are described: critical infrastructure, global risk, common good. Each of these qualifications entails the application of a particular legal regime and the involvement of specific governance actors. Thinking of the Internet as a common good requires us to consider the global management of its resources, namely data, on the model of the International Seabed Authority, for example. But unlike other international regimes for managing the commons, the resources constituted by digital data are not limited; on the contrary, they are growing exponentially. Existing regimes must therefore be adapted to the specificities of digital data.",
