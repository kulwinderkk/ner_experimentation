widely-acknowledged breakthroughs in AI and science that can benefit all of humanity include: mapping nearly all known proteins, predicting the function of proteins, mapping a piece of the brain in neuroscience research, discovering faster algorithms, and advances in quantum computing and physics including innovating in nuclear fusion.
Bring useful and transformational AI-powered infrastructure, products, and services to more people, businesses, organizations (large and small), and economies everywhere:
● Build state of the art AI infrastructure that is secure and easy to use, including compute (e.g. Tensor Processing Units, Google Tensor and Colab) and widely-used software frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, Jax, Android ML and Private Compute). Make this AI infrastructure available (with many open source tools) to millions of developers, students, and researchers in various organizations throughout the world, thus enabling digital transformation.
● Develop new AI-powered products, services and experiences for:
· Consumers with assistive tools like Google Translate, Google Lens, Google Assistant, Project Starline, Project Relate and Activate, speech-to-text, Pixel Call Assist and Recorder, real-time text suggestions and summarization, and generative human-assistive capabilities across many creative and productivity endeavors. To enhance all products that use speech, we've developed a Universal Speech Model capable of 400 languages and we are committed to building a model to support the 1000 most-spoken languages, improving access for billions of people.
· Businesses and organizations of all sizes, across industries and regions, with examples like contact center assistive agents, tools such as AutoML, Vertex AI, Cloud TPUs, Glass Enterprise, and assistive products for coding, design, and more still to come.
· Sectors that can most benefit from AI, from manufacturing to life sciences (e.g. diabetic retinopathy, imaging diagnostics, DeepVariant).
Work with and enable many others beyond Google to apply AI to help tackle society's greatest challenges and opportunities today and in the future.
● Collaborate with others around the world to apply AI to society's most pressing challenges such as natural disasters, public health crises, climate change, and sustainability. Notable examples include AI for Social Good, AI for the UN Sustainable Development Goals, Data Commons, wildfire alerts, coral reef conservation, and flood forecasting so far in more than 20 countries around the world.
● Jigsaw, a team within Google that builds technology to address threats to open societies, has leveraged advances in AI to build a free, public API called 'Perspective,' which enables moderators from over 800 publishers and platforms to identify and remove toxic comments, thus enabling more meaningful and less hateful conversations. Jigsaw also open-sourced 'Harassment Manager,' a free tool used by multiple NGOs that allows public figures including journalists,
