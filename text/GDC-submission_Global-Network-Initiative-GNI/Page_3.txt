o transparency and engagement to inform stakeholders about companies' policies and practices and promote the framework
· The GNI Principles are rooted in the United Nation Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and International Human Rights Law, which should remain core to any new principles and frameworks developed for an open, free, and secure digital future for all.
· The rights to freedom of expression and privacy should not be restricted by governments, except in narrowly defined circumstances based on internationally recognized laws or standards.
o Where governments seek to implement laws and regulations that might contribute to such restrictions, human rights principles can help them find creative and appropriate ways to engage stakeholders, design fit-for-purpose regulations, and mitigate unintended consequences.
· The state duty to protect human rights under the UNGPs builds on the obligation not to infringe upon human rights directly and includes both a duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, and a duty to ensure legal frameworks do not constrain but enable business respect for human rights.
· The principle of non-discrimination should be reflected in any content governance or regulation efforts.
· Multistakeholder engagement is a foundational principle in the history of global Internet governance that should be at the core of any additional efforts to set international norms and standards.
· There is a need for improved, meaningful digital transparency from digital communications companies as well as from governments and regulators in this space.
