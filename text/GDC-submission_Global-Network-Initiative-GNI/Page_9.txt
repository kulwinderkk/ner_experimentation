$_{·}$ Designing and introducing new technologies, products, and services, and their use, is one area where HRDD has previously revealed the need for HRIAs.
$_{●}$ Among other good practices, HRIAs should be prioritized where risks of adverse impacts are most salient, should be updated over time, and should draw upon insights from a variety of sources.
$_{●}$ GNI companies also commit to use best efforts ensure that business partners, investments, suppliers, distributors, and other relevant related parties follow these Principles.
$_{●}$ Recognizing the constant change in the ICT sector, GNI's multistakeholder membership commit to undertaking shared learning on contemporary freedom of expression and privacy challenges, including considerations around new and emerging technologies and the GNI framework.
$_{●}$ All stakeholders should give particular care to the potential freedom of expression risks associated with automated tools for content moderation;
$_{·}$ Requirements for companies to proactively filter types of harmful content require significant human rights scrutiny.
$_{●}$ We support the risk-based approach taken by various national and multilateral initiatives considering legal frameworks for AI, which target the uses of artificial intelligence that offer the most salient risks and tailor requirements for identifying, preventing, and mitigating risks accordingly.
$_{●}$ The application of artificial intelligence by public actors, including law enforcement, deserves at least as much, if not more, scrutiny as commercial applications in any regulatory framework. Requirements for privacy risk assessments or HRDD or HRIA should apply equally to commercial and public uses.
