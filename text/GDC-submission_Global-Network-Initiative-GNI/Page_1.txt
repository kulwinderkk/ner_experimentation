GNI Submission to the Global Digital Compact Consultation
The Global Network Initiative (GNI) welcomes the opportunity to submit input to the intergovernmental process on the Global Digital Compact. GNI has held multiple discussions with our full membership to inform the development of this submission, and we are pleased to be able to share core principles and commitments we hope to see reflected in the Global Digital Compact.
GNI's perspective is informed by over a decade and a half of experience undertaking multistakeholder collaboration to advance the GNI Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy and corresponding Implementation Guidelines (together, the GNI framework). The framework provides guidance on how information and communication technology (ICT) companies can build appropriate policies, systems, and capacity to advance responsible decision-making in response to government pressures, restrictions, or demands. GNI's expert members work together to uphold and promote this framework around the world, assess implementation of the framework by companies through our unique assessment process, participate in shared learning on related issues, challenges, and opportunities, and engage in policy advocacy in support of rights-respecting laws and policies.
GNI members include 90 leading digital rights and press freedom groups, information and communications and technology companies, investors, and academics. This experience guiding company action, undertaking shared learning, and engaging on laws and regulations across four policy areas-network disruptions, privacy and surveillance, jurisdictional assertions and limits, and content regulation-has offered valuable insights that can help guide all stakeholders in developing shared frameworks to help preserve a free, open, and secure Internet.
The GNI framework is centered on the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, and is consistent with the foundations of the broader UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
