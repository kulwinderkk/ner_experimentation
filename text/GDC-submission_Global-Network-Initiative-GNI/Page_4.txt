· Companies should commit to upholding human rights, including by implementing the UNGPs and the GNI Principles. GNI member companies commit to periodic independent assessment of their efforts to implement these principles with improvement over time via GNI's unique accountability mechanism.
· The GNI framework is focused on freedom of expression and privacy, but provides relevant guidance for addressing the full range of human rights risks and opportunities, including through the establishment of corporate commitments to human rights, developing comprehensive HRDD processes, engaging relevant stakeholders, practicing meaningful transparency, and providing appropriate senior/board-level oversight of these commitments and activities.
For Governments:
· Governments considering proposals to address concerns about digital content and conduct should incorporate the guidance detailed in the GNI Content Regulation & Human Rights Policy Brief (CRPB). Governments should conduct careful, public, and participatory deliberation on such proposals, and include strong transparency and accountability measures for relevant oversight or enforcement bodies.
· The CRPB details steps governments can take to uphold the human rights principles of legality, legitimacy, and necessity and proportionality, including:
o Legality-States should refrain from: using vague and reductive definitions that would incentivize over-removal; prohibiting categories of expressive conduct or content without engaging in a transparent and participatory process of debate; outsourcing adjudication of expression to private companies without providing appropriate clarity on interpretation and application of the law; or shifting legal liability from authors to intermediaries for illegal content generated by users.
o Legitimacy-States should refrain from allowing laws and/or regulation to result in discriminate against content based on medium.
o Necessity-States should refrain from: applying legal requirements on platforms without considering their relative size, capabilities, and business models;
