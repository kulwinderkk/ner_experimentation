· In looking to establish new mechanisms or update existing mechanisms for sharing digital evidence across borders for criminal investigations, governments should ensure the following principles are included to protect human rights: prior authorization of requests; focus on serious crimes; availability of meaningful redress; transparency regarding the number, type, and scope of the requests; and oversight and accountability.
· GNI recently expressed concerns about efforts from governments to ban or otherwise eliminate access to specific digital communications platforms. While governments may have legitimate concerns about the impact of digital content and conduct on specific platforms, completely blocking entire platforms, services, or mediums is almost never a necessary or proportionate response to such concerns.
· Regulators should continue to identify spaces to strengthen shared values and alignment on rights-respecting regulations.
For All Stakeholders
$_{●}$ Build capacity for and increased engagement with digital rights experts in global Internet governance conversations, including in standards bodies.
3) Focus Area: Promoting Artificial Intelligence
Principles
$_{●}$ As detailed in the GNI framework, consistent with the UNGPs, and considering international human rights standards, participating companies will carry out HRDD to identify, prevent, evaluate, mitigate and account for risks to the freedom of expression and privacy rights that are implicated by the company's products, services, activities and operations.
$_{·}$ Where HRDD identifies circumstances where freedom of expression and privacy may be jeopardized or advanced, GNI companies commit to employ human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) and develop effective risk mitigation strategies as appropriate.
