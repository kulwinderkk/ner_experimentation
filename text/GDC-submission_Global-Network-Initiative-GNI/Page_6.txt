· If national laws, regulations, and policies do not conform to international standards, the GNI framework details steps to avoid, minimize, or otherwise address the adverse impact of government demands, laws, or regulations, including:
o Requiring governments to follow established domestic laws and legal processes;
o Interpreting government requests narrowly, including regarding the requesting government's jurisdiction;
o Proactively engaging with governments to encourage laws, regulations, requirements, restrictions, and demands that are consistent with international laws and standards;
o Seeking the assistance, as needed, of relevant government authorities, international human rights bodies, or non-governmental organizations.
· Government-ordered network disruptions are drastic measures that almost always violate the principles of necessity and proportionality, often occurring during moments of political sensitivity or importance. Disruptions pose significant risks for human rights, as well as economic and social wellbeing.
· A small but growing number of governments also seek to implement measures centralizing state control over internet infrastructure, an approach that warrants opprobrium.
· Companies that hold user data can and should play an important role in scrutinizing and resisting improper, unnecessary, or disproportionate government demands. GNI recognizes that clear, rights-respecting, and efficient mechanisms for cross-border data sharing for the purposes of criminal investigations can help mitigate the risk of more restrictive alternatives, such as circumventing normal legal process to access user data or compelling data localization.
o GNI encourages bilateral, multilateral, and multistakeholder approaches that facilitate responses by companies who hold data abroad, where appropriate, to governments whose laws and procedures meet relevant international human rights standards.
