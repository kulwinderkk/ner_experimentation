Rights (UNGPs) and international human rights law. Our submission focuses on GNI's core commitments to freedom of expression and privacy, while emphasizing areas where the framework can provide guidance on policies and practices for addressing the full range of human rights, as well as issues where our policy and learning experiences offer insights for broader digital governance and policymaking with a human rights lens. Accordingly, we have organized the submission around core principles to preserve digital rights, and then spelled out specific commitments for companies, governments, and all stakeholders.
At the core of GNI's mission, governance, and work is a commitment to the inclusion of a broad diversity of voices and views and a shared belief in the values and principles established in international human rights law. We strongly encourage the co-chairs of the intergovernmental process, Member States, and all actors contributing to the multistakeholder technology track to ensure that the process and substance of developing the Global Digital Compact reflects this approach.
