4) Focus Area: Protect Data
Principles
$_{●}$ The GNI Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy and corresponding Implementation Guidelines call on companies to employ protections with respect to personal information in all countries where they operate in order to protect the privacy rights of users in the face of government demands and restrictions.
$_{●}$ The GNI framework encourages participating companies to disclose, to the extent allowed under the law, what laws and policies compel them to provide personal information to government authorities, what personal information the participating companies collect, and the company's policies and procedures for responding to government demands (see more about these policies and practices in the 'Internet Fragmentation' section).
$_{·}$ The framework also details that participating companies will assess the human rights risks associated with the collection, storage, and retention of personal information in the jurisdictions where they operate and develop appropriate mitigation strategies to address these risks.
$_{●}$ GNI encourages companies to adopt policies and procedures that address situations where governments may make demands through proxies and other third parties to evade domestic legal procedures.
