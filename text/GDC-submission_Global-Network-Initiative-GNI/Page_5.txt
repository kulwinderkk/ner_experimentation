For All Stakeholders
· Where the Global Digital Compact may speak to potential regulatory approaches, we encourage the promotion of first principles, key safeguards, and flexible guidance, as opposed to more rigid regulatory frameworks that can be misconstrued to justify undue restrictions and will have different implications and impacts in distinct jurisdictions depending on context, including resourcing and rule-of-law adherence.
· The Global Digital Compact consultations and ultimate output should explore avenues to reinforce and build upon existing efforts to empower multistakeholder processes and support work toward a free, open, interoperable, and secure Internet, such efforts being undertaken through the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), the Christchurch Call, the Freedom Online Coalition, and the Action Coalition on Meaningful Transparency.
· Continue to build on efforts to identify good practices for meaningful and inclusive stakeholder engagement on digital rights issues.

Principles

· The GNI Principles and Implementation Guidelines make clear that ICT companies should comply with all applicable laws and respect internationally recognized human rights, wherever they operate.
