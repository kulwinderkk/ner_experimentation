6. In this regard, we recognize the role of the Commission on Science and Technology for Development as the United Nations focal point for science, technology and innovation for development, as well as the focal point in the system-wide follow-up to the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). The negotiations around the Global Digital Compact should not diminish the role of the CSTD.

8. The Group underscores that the outcomes of the WSIS should be preserved as a guide for digital international cooperation and for Internet governance, since it is based on principles that favor development.
9. The Tunis Agenda and the Geneva Declaration of Principles and plan of action shall lay down the guiding principles for the development of any new mechanism on digital cooperation, including GDC.
10. We underline the need to focus on capacity-development policies and sustainable support to further enhance the impact of activities and initiatives at the national and local levels aimed at providing advice, services and support, with a view to building an inclusive, people-centered and development-oriented information society.
11. We recognize that no single country or stakeholder, or a small group thereof, should be allowed to monopolize or control the Internet core infrastructure.
