G77 and China inputs to the Global Digital Compact discussions
1. The Group emphasizes that the Global Digital Compact (GDC) must be a States-led process and ensure full and equal participation of all States, especially developing countries.
2. For the Group, the important issues pertaining to digital cooperation remain an inclusive digital economy and literacy, access to digital networks and connectivity, capacity building and technology transfer, investment in digital infrastructures, data protection, data governance, artificial intelligence, avoiding Internet division and fragmentation, countering the proliferation of disinformation and misinformation and to outline shared principles for a digital future for all to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
3. The Global Digital Compact should build upon key documents and forums to advance digital cooperation, inter alia, the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), in particular the Tunis Agenda and the Geneva Plan of Action, the Internet Governance Forum, and take into account the Secretary-General Roadmap for Digital Cooperation.
4. In order to secure meaningful results, the Global Digital Compact should outline concrete actions and specific initiatives to harness digital technologies to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
5. We emphasize the importance of ensuring synergies and avoiding duplication across various entities working on digital cooperation. To this end, the Group would like to draw attention to other important existing platforms for enhancing digital cooperation, such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the WSIS, the Internet Governance Forum, the STI Forum under the ECOSOC,
