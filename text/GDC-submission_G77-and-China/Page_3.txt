12. States which have monopoly and dominance in ICT environment, including internet, shall not use ICT advances as tools for containment and suppression of the legitimate economic and technological development of other States. The GDC should reaffirm its firm rejection of the imposition of laws and regulations with extraterritorial impact and all other forms of coercive economic measures, including unilateral sanctions, against developing countries and reiterate the urgent need to eliminate them immediately. The GDC should emphasize that such actions not only undermine the principles enshrined in the Charter of the UN and international law but also severely threaten the freedom of trade and investment. The GDC should therefore call upon the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries. The call to maintain an open, stable and resilient supply chain of global ICT products and services by GDC is necessary.
13. The Global Digital Compact should reaffirm the right to development.
14. Private sector and social media platforms should observe rules, norms and policies of the countries where they operate and should be also accountable for their behavior in ICT environment. States may, as appropriate, also consider ways and means to hold them responsible, ensure appropriate measures with a view to making private sector with extra-territorial impacts, including platforms, accountable for their behavior in the ICT environment, and exercise due control over ICT companies and platforms under their jurisdiction.
15. As regards the 'multistakeholder' concept developed by Tunis Agenda, there is a strong need that stakeholders observe national laws, regulations, principles, rules and norms for their responsible behavior in ICT environment.
