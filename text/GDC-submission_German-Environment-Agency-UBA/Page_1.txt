GERMAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY SUBMISSION TO THE GDC
A.PROCESS OF PREPARATION
As we continue to advance in the digital age, it's critical to analyse how digitalisation impacts the environment. At the German Environment Agency (UBA), our goal is to make digitalisation environmentally friendly, and to foster digital and socio-technical solutions towards sustainability.
That's why UBA serves as a dedicated Co-Champion of the Coalition for Digital Environmental Sustainability (CODES), a global alliance working for a Sustainable Planet in the Digital Age. CODES was mandated by the UN Envoy on Technology to address the nexus between digital transformation and environmental sustainability as part of the follow-up process to the UN Secretary General's Roadmap for Digital Cooperation.
This submission expresses the view of UBA in its capacity as a co-champion of CODES.

Any views expressed are the views of the UBA and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the Federal Republic of Germany.
