Contribution from the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE) April 2023
On behalf of the Board of the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE) Foundation, we submit the following contribution to the Global Digital Compact. The GFCE appreciates that the consultative process on the Global Digital Compact is inclusive and transparent, ensuring that the voices of civil society and multi-stakeholder actors are represented appropriately. The GFCE would also like to recognize the efforts of the UN Tech Envoy office, and co-facilitators Rwanda and Sweden, in paving the way towards consensus on shared principles for an open, free and secure digital future for all.
The GFCE is a neutral, apolitical platform for international cooperation and exchange on strengthening cyber capacity and expertise globally. Established in 2015, its multi-stakeholder network comprises of over 190 organizations including governments, civil society, academia, private sector, and international organizations. On this occasion, we respectfully provide input on digital connectivity for your consideration.
1. Connect all people to the internet, including all schools
The GFCE believes that every citizen of the world should be able to fully reap the benefits of information communication technologies (ICTs) through a free, open, peaceful and secure digital world. The GFCE is committed to advancing digital connectivity as a vital driver of sustainable development and human rights for all people. Digital connectivity also contributes to the realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. At the same time, we recognize that digital connectivity comes with challenges and risks, as cyberspace is increasingly exploited by malicious actors. Therefore, the GFCE advocates for cybersecurity and cyber capacity building as crucial elements to digital connectivity, as they enable countries and communities to protect themselves from cyber threats and vulnerabilities, develop skills, and harness the opportunities of cyberspace.

· Bridging the digital divide requires collaboration between governments, the private sector, civil society, and other stakeholders.
· Cybersecurity and cyber capacity building are essential components of digital connectivity, as they ensure countries and communities can protect themselves from cyber threats and vulnerabilities, and fully leverage the benefits of cyberspace.
