1 The GFCE has developed capacity building principles as codified in the GFCE’s Delhi Communiqué on  the  Global Agenda for Cyber Capacity Building , endorsed by the GFCE community. These principles  were based on general principles for development and capacity building set out in the Busan Partnership  for Effective Development Co-operation, directly linking thus cyber capacity building with international  development principles.   
2 To this end, the GFCE is co-organizing a Global Conference on Cyber Capacity Building in 2023, in  partnership with the World Bank, World Economic Forum and Cyber Peace Institute, and with the support  of several UN Member States. Amongst other things, the Conference will raise decision-makers’  awareness of how cybersecurity and capacity building support digital, social and economic development,  in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
