reaffirm them as features of the current digital governance regime. In consequence, we encourage the GDC to treat the above outlined as indissolubly intertwined principles.
A human-centred model for digital governance that enable people to collectively negotiate who accesses data about them and under what terms, coupled with fiduciary obligations for data holders, and the adoption of these principles by AI actors will likely help to regulate not only the tech industry but also traditional and established markets that have embraced technification. For example, when heavily unregulated markets such as smart health tracking devices (e.g. smartwatches and fitness apps) and online decentralised lending Apps, are bound by a human-needs first oversight most of the imbalances and abuses they carry will heavily disappear.
Finally, the GIDE recognises that human empowerment and people-centred data governance regimes can be achieved through many paths, including modifying existing technical architecture, conducting legal reforms or creating new legal concepts. We call for the GDC to adopt such a neutral position in developing the next stage of digital governance.
