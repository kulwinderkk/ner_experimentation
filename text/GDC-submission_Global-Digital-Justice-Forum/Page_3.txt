 Submission of Inputs for the Global Digital Compact 
 Global Digital Justice Forum
We believe that for this opportunity to materialize, the GDC must unequivocally reject the 'equal footing' multistakeholder model that has dominated digital cooperation processes, leading to an entrenchment of corporate power. Instead, it must build on WSIS outcomes, which still remain valid. The GDC must set up a new democratic global digital governance framework founded in a human rights-based constitutionalism that acknowledges the legitimate role of governments in digital policymaking.
The Global Digital Justice Forum sees a strong and central role for civil society and the social movements in global to local digital policymaking. As acknowledged by the WSIS, the Internet is a unique artifact, and a communication commons belonging to the people of the world. We believe that there is no digital cooperation without the participation of people in agenda-setting for an equitable, inclusive, and development-oriented digital society. The standpoints of those at the margins of society must inform processes towards the GDC. The multilateral system and governments need to use the creative potential of the Internet to ensure that such participation is not just notional, but as democratized and meaningful as possible, so that policies are agile, accountable, and attentive to people and the planet. The so-called digital divide is fundamentally a development divide. The commitments of the international community in delivering the 2030 Agenda should not be derailed or undermined by or be dependent on digitaliza tion. Rather, the GDC must strive to ensure that digitalization is a positive force for the right of all to live well with dignity.
The members of the Global Digital Justice Forum, on the basis of their committed engagement on digital justice, seek to contribute to the GDC process to co-evolve the norms, principles, and policies for a future digitality based on a commitment to the integrated and indivisible human rights agenda, including, the right to development, pluralism of knowledges, wellbeing of planet and people, and human flourishing.
