Submission of Inputs for the Global Digital Compact
Global Digital Justice Forum
ABOUT
The Global Digital Justice Forum is a multisectoral group of development organizations, digital rights networks, trade unions, feminist groups, corporate watchdogs, and communication rights campaigners [including, Campaign of Campaigns, Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN), Equidad, ETC Group, Global Policy Forum, Groupe de Recherche Pour Une Stratégie Économique Alternative (GRESEA), IT for Change, Just Net Coalition, Latin American Information Agency (ALAI), Oxfam International, Public Services International (PSI), Social Watch, The Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO), Third World Network, Transnational Institute (TNI)] led by a digital justice vision.
This submission has been co-constructed by the group through the past several months of dialogue, deliberation and consultation with several communities in the Global South. It has also been circulated among partners and collaborators of the Forum's members, and validated by Asociación Latinoamericana de Educación y Comunicación Popular (ALER), Foro Argentino de Radios Comunitarias (FARCO), Global Initiative for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (GI-ESCR), Internet Bolivia, Internet Ciudadana, and Pressenza.
The group has been working together to build a Global South perspective on digital technologies through policy engagement spanning local to global levels, including UN forums-on Internet and data, biodiversity and environment, trade, labor rights, gender equality, development cooperation, SDGs, global governance, multilateral reform, etc.
The work of the group (individually and collectively) over the past two decades-predating the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) process-is informed by a vision towards and practical action for:
a) democratizing the governance of digital technologies and promoting decentralized digital systems;
b) upholding the Internet as a global commons that can decentralize knowledge and power in our society and economy, enabling global exchange of information and knowledge, vibrant peer production cultures, sustainable local economies, free expression and association, and democratic deliberation and participation;
c) privileging a people-led, ecologically responsible, non-extractive, rights-enabling and gender-just vision of technology models that furthers a new international order rooted in development sovereignty;
d) calling for an end to corporate impunity; and
e) developing legal-policy frameworks for data, AI, and platforms grounded in human rights and economic justice on both transversal technological aspects and domain-specific/sectoral issues.
The members of the Global Digital Justice Forum consider the GDC as an important milestone that could (as the UN SG asserts in his Report to the Commission on Science, Technology and Development) become 'an opportunity for Governments and other stakeholders to revitalize international cooperation in the light of the dramatic changes that have taken place in digital technology since WSIS' (Para 98, A 78/62-E/2023/49).
