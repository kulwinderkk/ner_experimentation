2. Harness the Internet and the social resource of data and data-based intelligence as a future-ready force for gender-transformative, ecologically compatible development if Agenda 2030 is to be realized.
3. Reform the international taxation regime to stop base erosion and profit shifting practices of transnational digital corporations, in order to enable states in the global South to generate adequate fiscal revenues for social care infrastructure.
Actions-Governments
1. Adopt and enforce feminist economic policy measures that apply not only to the world of work, but also recognize the human right to care, redistribute care work from families to public services, and obligate the state to provision care systems and services as a public good. The ILO's 5R Framework for decent care work is an important starting point. Without this, exploitation of women's labor and unpaid care work in the platform economy cannot be stopped.
2. Prioritize investments in platform and AI models that address social bias and promote gender equality.
