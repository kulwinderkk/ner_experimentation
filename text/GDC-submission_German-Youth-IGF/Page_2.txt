racist data. Such data must be rigorously flagged and removed from the
training datasets. Gender sensitivity as well as an intersectional approach is
important. [ALL STAREHELOERS)

Protect data

1.

Global Digital Compact Contribution Youth IGF Germany

Personal data, especially the most sensitive, must be well protected, for
example through “privacy by design solutions” for software and hardware.
[BUSINESS and TECHNICAL COMMUNITY]

. Data protection must not be used as a political tool to inhibit civil society

engagement in particular. (GOVERNMENTS, CIVIL SOCIETY]

. The use of privacy-friendly cookies must be made a mandatory default setting

for websites. ("Dark Patterns") [GOVERNMENTS]

. When it comes to data protection, European norms should not be assumed as

"superior" or "gold standard", but other cultural norms and approaches should

also be considered (e.g. indigenous data management: CARE Principles).

[GOVERNMENTS and BUSINESS]

Children and young people should be allowed to have a say in what happens
to their data from a certain age (not just their guardians). [GOVERNMENTS]
