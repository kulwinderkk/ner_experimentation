Therefore, internet shutdowns and content blocking may constitute violations of the principles contained in several international human rights instruments, in particular article 19 (right to freedom of expression, the scope of which is clarified by General Comment 34 of the Human Rights Committee) and article 21 (right of assembly) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Regional conventions for the protection of human rights generally include similar provisions.\n",
    "        This perspective is supported by the practice of several organs and international institutions, notably resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council on 'The promotion, protection and fulfillment of human rights on the Internet' (A/HRC/32/L.20, June 27th, 2016). The Council condemns measures that seek to ' intentionally prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information online in violation of international human rights law, and calls upon all States to refrain from and cease such measures ', relying on a substantial number of secondary legislation not specifically related to the issue of Internet access. Several UN Special Rapporteurs have recognized the fundamental nature of the right of access to the Internet through the prism of freedom of expression or the right to peaceful assembly. However, this right of access to the internet should not be construed as a duty of States to provide access without any charge.'\n",
